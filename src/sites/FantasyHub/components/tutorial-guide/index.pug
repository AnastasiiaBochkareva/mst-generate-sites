                p To build a strong fantasy football team in TotalStriker, follow these steps:
                ul 
                    li Choose a balanced formation like 4-3-3 or 3-5-2 to maximize both attack and defense.
                    li Select a goalkeeper from a team with a solid defense—clean sheets mean extra points.
                    li Prioritize midfielders who score goals and provide assists (box-to-box players).
                    li Avoid selecting too many players from the same club—if they have a bad week, your whole team suffers.

                    li Don’t ignore defenders who contribute to attacks (wing-backs with high crossing ability).
                    li Use your captain choice wisely—pick a reliable goal-scorer for double points.

                ul

                    li Pick at least one death-over bowler—they bowl in crucial moments and take wickets.
                    li Avoid selecting too many bowlers in short-format games (T20s focus more on big-hitting batsmen).

                ul 
                    li Analyze pitch reports—slow pitches favor spinners, while bouncy tracks suit fast bowlers.
                    li Rotate your players based on match format (ODI, T20, Test)—some players perform better in specific formats.
                    li Choose a wicketkeeper who bats in the top order—lower-order keepers don’t get enough chances.

                ul 
                    li Avoid picking players just based on reputation—focus on their recent form.
                    li Choose a vice-captain from a different discipline than your captain (one batsman, one bowler) to balance risks.
                    li Keep track of last-minute team changes—if a player is benched, you need to swap them out fast.
